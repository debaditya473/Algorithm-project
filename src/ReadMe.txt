There are three code files.

Part 1 of the project is in the file MinimumSpanningTree.c file. 
It can be run from the terminal using a gcc compiler.
Input/Output Specifications have been provided in the presentation.

Part 2 of the project is in the file ShortestPath.c file. 
It can be run from the terminal using a gcc compiler.
Input/Output Specifications have been provided in the presentation.

The third file is Visualiser.cpp. 
It has the same algorithm as part 2, 
however it also includes an opencv visualisation of the graph (grid).
It also finds the most suitable city-centre, highlights it, and marks the path to the furthest house.
To run this file, the opencv c++ library must be present on the system path/this folder.
